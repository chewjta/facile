### Inspiration

##### Before enrolling in General Assembly, I used to self learn coding via tutorials on Udemy. 

However, the one time upfront payment for each individual courses meant I canâ€™t back out even if the course is not for me. 

##### Why not Skillshare? 

Basically a short answer is the interface is confusing and everything coding related is themed under web dev, so its hard to find react or iOS dev tutorials specifically. 

##### What about fitness tutorials? 

During the COVID-19 lockdown period, I noticed lots of people searching for online follow along fitness workouts, and I kinda think it will be awesome to have a platform with a simple interface for users to access such videos easily. 


#### For Whom?

Coding tutorials for programmers of any languages or skill level looking to further increase their knowledge on their respective fields. 

People who prefer working out in their own private zones but are afraid/ do not like going to the gym. 

People who want to learn a new skill and want a simple platform to do so! Binge-watching is sure a good way to start!
